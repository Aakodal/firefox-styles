# Firefox Styles

Some `userChrome.css` files in order to customize your Firefox experience.
This repository is not a tutorial on how to use `userChrome.css`. Moreover, I will likely not make any previews of my files because I have neither time nor will to do it.

If you want to live-test a style, please refer to [this tutorial](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/comments/73dvty/tutorial_how_to_create_and_livedebug_userchromecss/).
